Tenki Compare
=============

Weather comparison website, http://www.tenkicompare.com

This repository contains
 - the data pulled from government agencies
 - the script to parse the data into JSON
 - the single-page website
 - and all the libraries to run it

My code probably isn't useful to anyone else, but the data might be.

See http://www.iaindunning/?p=101 for the genesis of this project.
